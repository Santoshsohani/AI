# 1. Impact of AI on Product Development
Imapct of AI replicates, How AI can be utilized to design, build, test products which can be both in 
- Software (Eg: Cursor)
- Hardware (Eg: Self Driving Cars)

## Key Imapcts of AI on Product Development
1. Faster Prototyping : AI Can analyze trends, customer needs, Using generative AI deisgn proptotypes can be created quickly.
2. Smarter Features : AI Can provide smarter features such as Rrcommendation engines, smart assistants etc
3. Personalization : AI Can provide personal recommendations like how spotify makes a personalized playlist based upon listening history.
4. Better Decision Making : Based upon a given input query AI can be helpful in better decison making under given conditions.

## Real world examples
- Tesla : Autonomous driving cars
- Figma : AI Suggestion to generate design components
- Spotify : Personalized playlist generations

# 2. Generative AI 
Generative AI engineer is a person who used the existsing models, fine-tune it if required and integrate in the applications, to solve a complex logic and generate response for a given input.
The reponse could be text (mostly), images, audio & even videos.
The Main role consists of:
- Designing and Developing REST API's
- Integrating LLM's
- Prompt Engineering
- Custom Module Training

# 3. LLM
LLM : Large Language Models
It is a artificial intelligence model which is trained on huge amount of text data, which can be used to perform various Natural language processing operations such as text generations, summarization, translations, question answering etc.

- **Large**: Huge Data which is used to train
- **Language**: It refers where models can perform natural language operations (English, Hindi, Spanish)
- **Model**: In ML model is nothing but a function which takes inputs (Natural Language) & Provides output (Some natural language operation)

# 4. Inference
Inference refers to using a trained model to make predictions or decisions using some unseen data.

**Example** : A spam detection model which is being trained on huge set of spam emails, which can be seen implemented in Gmail or Outlook, such that any new spam email arrives can be flagged as spam


# 5. Training
Training refers to when a model** learns patterns** from a given set of data. Such that any unseen data is given as an input may result in perfect predictions or decision making.

**Example**: A spam detection model will be trained on huge set of spam emails, Such that if any new spam email arrives it may flag that email as an **Spam Email**
