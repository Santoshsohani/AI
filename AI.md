# 1. Impact of AI on Product Development
Imapct of AI replicates, How AI can be utilized to design, build, test products which can be both in 
- Software (Eg: Cursor)
- Hardware (Eg: Self Driving Cars)

## Key Imapcts of AI on Product Development
1. Faster Prototyping : AI Can analyze trends, customer needs, Using generative AI deisgn proptotypes can be created quickly.
2. Smarter Features : AI Can provide smarter features such as Rrcommendation engines, smart assistants etc
3. Personalization : AI Can provide personal recommendations like how spotify makes a personalized playlist based upon listening history.
4. Better Decision Making : Based upon a given input query AI can be helpful in better decison making under given conditions.

## Real world examples
- Tesla : Autonomous driving cars
- Figma : AI Suggestion to generate design components
- Spotify : Personalized playlist generations

# 2. Generative AI 
Generative AI engineer is a person who used the existsing models, fine-tune it if required and integrate in the applications, to solve a complex logic and generate response for a given input.
The reponse could be text (mostly), images, audio & even videos.
The Main role consists of:
- Designing and Developing REST API's
- Integrating LLM's
- Prompt Engineering
- Custom Module Training

# 3. LLM
LLM : Large Language Models
It is a artificial intelligence model which is trained on huge amount of text data, which can be used to perform various Natural language processing operations such as text generations, summarization, translations, question answering etc.

- **Large**: Huge Data which is used to train
- **Language**: It refers where models can perform natural language operations (English, Hindi, Spanish)
- **Model**: In ML model is nothing but a function which takes inputs (Natural Language) & Provides output (Some natural language operation)

# 4. Inference
Inference refers to using a trained model to make predictions or decisions using some unseen data.

**Example** : A spam detection model which is being trained on huge set of spam emails, which can be seen implemented in Gmail or Outlook, such that any new spam email arrives can be flagged as spam


# 5. Training 
Training refers to when a model **learns patterns** from a given set of data. Such that any unseen data is given as an input may result in perfect predictions or decision making.

**Example**: A spam detection model will be trained on huge set of spam emails, Such that if any new spam email arrives it may flag that email as an **Spam Email**

# 6. Embeddings
Embeddings in the field of Artificial Intelligence is an dense numerical vector in the range of `-1 to 1` It is used to represent words, sentence, letters in a numerical format such that it is understood by the large language model -- which then predicts the next word (token)

# 7. Vector Database
It is a special database which is used to store vectors which are the numerical representations of unstructured data:
- Text
- Images
- Code
- Video's
Vector Database provides features like:
- Storing 
- Indexing - Faster retrieval 
- Search - Cosine similarity, Dot 

Example : FAISS (Facebook AI similarity search), PineCone, Qdrant 

# 8. AI Agent
AI Agent is an entity which perceives its environment, makes decision and behaves autonomously to achieve a given task.
It consists of various components like - LLM, Memory, Tools, Environment

**Flow of an AI Agent:**
Environment -- Perceives -- Reason -- Act -- Environment 

# 9. RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
It is an AI architecture which uses the concept of retrieval combined with a generative model which could be an LLM.
It uses external source such as a database or documents to generate accurate and grounded results.

**Flow of RAG**
- User Query
- Similarity Search from a Vector Database
- Combine user query and retrieved results
- Generate result from LLM

# 10. Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is a way of optimizing inputs and guide the AI models to  generate results effectively.

Quote : **English is the new programming language**
This emphasizes how English basically prompting has become a significant entity in the field of Generative AI
